# because it's faster to get. When this setting is enabled, Dovecot still
# tries to do the right thing first, but if that requires opening the

#  %u - Mail's IMAP UID
#  %m - MD5 sum of the mailbox headers in hex (mbox only)

#
# Note that Outlook 2003 seems to have problems with %v.%u format which was
