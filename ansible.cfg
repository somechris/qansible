# If a file on a host and a rendered template differ by only their
# ansible_managed (which by default contains an ever changing
# timestamp), the two files are considered different (at least in
# Ansible 1.9.3), and handlers are triggered. This is potentially
# dangerous for Trouts. Deploying the role, will update the timestamp,
# and all upstart configs would get the new timestamp and be
# considered different. Hence, all Trouts would unneededly restart at
# the same time, which would cause issues on the Trout networks.  To
# work around this, and still get the best out of handlers, we turn
# ansible_managed into a static string, which does not lead to
# changes. Thereby working around the above issue.
ansible_managed = DO NOT EDIT. This file is managed by Ansible.
